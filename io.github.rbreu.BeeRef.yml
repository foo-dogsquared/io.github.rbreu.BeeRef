  # The following shouldn't be manually edited.
  # It is generated from the `flatpak-builder-tools` (https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak-builder-tools).
  # You should be able to generate one by running the following command:

  # > flatpak-builder-tools/pip/flatpak-pip-generator -o python3-setup.json <PACKAGES_IN_setup.py>...
  - ./deps/python3-setup.json
  - ./deps/python3-sip.json

  - ./deps/python3-PyQt-builder.json

  # On the other hand, this is manually edited.
  # It is not included because one of the dependencies doesn't have a source to be able to build.
  # See the related issue: https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak-builder-tools/issues/26
